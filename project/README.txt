Welcome! This is The Collector's Corner, a collection management system for collectors of fine art. Collectors can sign up to catalog the pieces in their collections. 

The application uses SQLite3 for the database and Python's Flask framework for the user interface. The HTML is rendered server-side using the Jinja templating engine. 

The database is initialized from the root (project) folder with the "flask init-db" command. The development server is launched with the "flask run" command.
